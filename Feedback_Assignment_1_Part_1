I do not have access to your repo. I need permission.

Ok, based on your description, it appears that what you want to build is going to be "minimalist". I want to make sure that you have enough work for the semester. The assignment says:

"â€¢ Your project must have a substantial user interface. A system that simply displays static information or administers a form is not enough. (A very rough guideline: your finished project should have at least 3 major screens with at least a dozen UI widgets total.....perhaps a better rule is that your interface design shouldn't be obvious.  If your group doesn't need to debate the design in some way, then it's not appropriate)."

If you feel that your project has enough complexity (in term of UI design work) then go ahead and submit part 2. It is better to overestimate and then cut down work than underestimate and end up doing something too simple.

Talk to me if you have any questions.
