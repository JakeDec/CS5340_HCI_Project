Here's what we owe to complete the first group assignment:

Proposal
Your final proposal should be 1-2 pages long, and include the following parts:

Problem. Describe the problem you chose and how the system will help users. 
Target users. Characterize the user population.
A preliminary (ie fast) academic literature review + review of existing systems.  It should be clear that your group looked at what came before and is fully aware where the research fits in the bigger picture. I expect citations (and recent ones). You should definitely do some research before designing your system. If a solution already exists and you don't address what makes your approach different, then you will lose a lot of points.
